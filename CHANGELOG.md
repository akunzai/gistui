# Changelog

All notable changes are summarised here. Each version links to its full,
auto-generated notes on the [GitHub Releases][releases] page, which remains the
authoritative source.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
(currently `0.x` while the keymap/feature surface is still evolving).

## [Unreleased]

- Mouse support: wheel scroll, click to focus/select, double-click to open, and a clickable close button on pop-up screens (on by default; disable with `mouse = false` or `--no-mouse`).
- Startup update check: on launch gistui checks GitHub (once a day, silently) for a newer release and shows a footer hint with the right upgrade command if one exists (disable with `check_updates = false` or `--no-update-check`).
- Diff view: `w` toggles soft line wrapping — long lines wrap to the width instead of needing horizontal scroll (mirrors the preview's wrap toggle).

## [0.12.0] — 2026-06-19

- Vim-style navigation: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l` move and scroll alongside arrow keys; `Ctrl+b` / `Ctrl+f` page up/down by 10 (same as PageUp/PageDown) on every scrollable screen, including the main list (Files/Gists panes), Pins, and Gist manager. Revision history is now `H` (was `h`); cycling the revision target file is `F` (was `f`).
- Fixed: `T` theme toggle stopped working after vim navigation began passing real key modifiers (Shift+T was ignored).
- README slimmed for scannability: installation and safety reference docs moved to `reference/` (kept out of GitHub Pages `docs/`); contributor/agent sections to `CONTRIBUTING.md` / `AGENTS.md`; Usage keeps essential keys and points to in-app `?` for the complete keymap. Landing page updated (install link-out, current gist-manager copy, doc footer links).
- Gist detail: `*` stars or unstars the open gist (footer hint + `★ starred` in the info line when starred); the info line also shows `☆ N` (stargazers), `⑂ N` (forks), and `💬 N` (comments) when non-zero.
- Edit description (`e`), compact revisions (`c`), and delete gist (`X`) moved from the gist manager to gist detail; they appear only for gists you own (silent no-op on others' gists — no read-only warning).
- Image and other binary gist files cannot be previewed or diffed in the TUI (detected via the list API MIME type and filename); the file list tags them `(binary)` and status suggests `o` (browser) or `d` (download) instead.
- Owned forks now appear under the `forked` visibility filter: the gist list API omits `fork_of`, so gistui detects them via GraphQL `isFork` and fills the upstream id from the full gist object (fixes missing forks such as old forked scripts that still show on gist.github.com).
- Revision diffs (incremental and vs current) fetch file content via `gist.githubusercontent.com/.../raw/{sha}/{file}` when the revision API returns HTTP 502 on large gists (same class of fix as preview `raw_url` fallback).
- `F` fork is available only in gist detail, and only for gists you do not own (removed from the main list and gist manager).
- Gist detail comments load only when you open the Comments tab (no upfront fetch on Enter). Gist manager and detail view show `@owner` on gists you do not own. Preview/download falls back to the list API `raw_url` when `gh gist view` fails (e.g. huge starred gists returning HTTP 502). Startup cache now includes starred gists and fork/comment/star counts; fork and stargazer counts refresh in the background so the list appears sooner.
- Starred and forked gists: `v` cycles five visibility modes (all / public / secret / starred / forked); `*` stars or unstars the context gist; `F` forks a gist you do not own into your account. Others' starred gists are read-only (preview, diff, download, browser) — pin, upload, delete, compact, and restore are blocked. The gist manager title shows your starred and owned-fork totals (`★` / `⑂`); rows show `☆ N` (GitHub stargazers), `⑂ N` (forks), and `💬 N` (comments) when non-zero.
- Gist revision history: press `H` on a gist file in the main list, gist manager, or gist detail view to browse revisions (newest first), show the incremental diff for a revision (`Enter`, parent → selected), diff against the current version (`D`), and restore a single file from an older revision (`r`, `y`/`n` confirm — creates a new revision, unlike `c` compact which deletes history). In revision history, `F` cycles the target file on multi-file gists. Revision diffs are read-only (no `d`/`u` download/upload).

## [0.11.0] — 2026-06-17

- Built-in light/dark colour theme: set `theme = "light"` in `config.toml` for terminals with a light background, or press `T` at any time to toggle and save instantly.
- Pre-built binary installs can self-upgrade from GitHub Releases: `gistui --upgrade` (latest), `gistui --upgrade --check` (compare only), and `gistui --upgrade --upgrade-version <tag>` (pin a release). Homebrew, Scoop (including the `scoop/shims/gistui.exe` PATH shim), and cargo installs are detected and pointed at their own upgrade commands instead.
- Pins screen: `o` cycles sort order (default / local path / gist filename); active sort shown in the title bar.
- Pins screen: after a `d` pull completes, the view stays on Pins instead of returning to the main list.
- Confirm overwrite prompt now shows `~`-shortened paths instead of full absolute paths.
- Fixed: pressing `u` or `d` in the diff screen opened from Pins (Enter or `d`-pull) now correctly targets the pin pair's local file instead of the Files-view selection; `record_pin_sync` also fires correctly after a confirmed pull.

## [0.10.0] — 2026-06-16

- `?` help is now contextual: it opens the current screen's keys (and is reachable from the Pins, Gist manager, and Gist detail screens, not just the list), with `Tab` to browse an index of all topics instead of scrolling one long page.
- Local file list now has a text filter: `/` filters the focused pane (Local matches path/filename, Gist matches description/id). Filtering supports typing-while-navigating (↑/↓), `Tab` to apply and switch panes, and `Backspace` on an empty query to exit.
- The Pinned Mappings screen (`P`) gained the same `/` text filter — matches the local path or gist filename, with live ↑/↓ navigation.
- Pin times are now consistent between the Pins list and the diff view: pins pointing outside the scanned working directory show the real local mtime (and a correct ↑/↓ sync status) instead of `?`, and the pin diff header shows the gist's update time instead of `unknown`.
- Inline text inputs (gist description editor and every `/` filter) are now full single-line editors: `←`/`→`/`Home`/`End` move the cursor and `Backspace`/`Del` delete around it, with a block cursor showing its real position — no more deleting back to fix an earlier character.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-06-14

- Gist detail view is now tabbed — a `Files │ Comments` strip under the basic info shows one
  pane at a time (opens on the Files tab; `Tab` switches), instead of stacking both panes.
- Scrollbar on the gist-detail comments pane (the Diff and Preview panes already had one).
- Item counts in the Local, Gists and Pins titles (e.g. `Gists (3/12)` when a filter is
  active, `(N)` otherwise), matching the existing `Files (N)` / `Comments (N)` style.
- Gist manager rows show a `💬 N` comment count for gists that have comments (drawn from the
  existing gist-list fetch — no extra API calls).
- Animated spinner on the scanning, loading and working states (replaces the static `⏳`),
  so long-running `gh` operations no longer look frozen.
- Install from crates.io: `cargo install gistui`, or `cargo binstall gistui` for the
  prebuilt release binaries.
